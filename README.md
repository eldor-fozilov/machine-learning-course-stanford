## Machine Learning Course on Coursera offered by Stanford University
It was a pleasure to take that course and learn from one of the biggest experts in machine learning, Andrew Ng.
I would recommend taking this course for anyone interested in learning basic/advanced machine learning algorithms on a fairly deep level and applying them to real-world problems. The knowledge from that course will benefit you regardless of your domain since machine learning is expected to enter almost every field in the future.

Here in the repository, I have the completed weekly assignments and quizzes given in that course. You can take a look at them if you struggle when taking the course.
The course covers from basic learning algorithms such as **linear regression**, **logistic regression** to more advanced types such **SVMs** and **neural networks**. Unsupervised learning algorithms such as **K-means**, **PCA**, **Anomaly Detection** also covered in the last weeks of the class. 

Besides that, you will learn about how to evaluate machine learning algorithms and build ml systems (related concepts: **Bias/Variance Trade-off**, **Learning Curves**, **Error Analysis**, **Ceiling Analysis**, etc.)

**Good luck in your learning!**
